## My comments
The title of this article caught my eye as it initially got me thinking AI was already starting to replace software engineers. Upon reading the article, it reaffirmed my prior belief that AI will remain, at least for the foreseeable future, a supplement to the work of software engineers. The article then prompted me to wonder how commercialized such AI tools will eventually become, and whether they should and will be free and open-source instead. As more and more such tools like Cognizant's Flowsource emerge, the greater competition could hopefully bring down prices.

## James' Comments
This is an incredibly interesting concept about the potentials of AI within the realm of software development, particularly how generative AI is actually a tool for developers to help productivity instead of a replacement. The development of proprietary AI as in Cognizant's Flowsource emerge is just further proof that the AI craze that has taken over the world is more of a product of clever marketing instead of replacement.
